# MATLAB FDFD Photonic Simulation Toolbox
Photonic Finite-Difference Frequency-Domain (FDFD) Toolbox is a MATLAB Community Toolbox project, aiming 
to provide intuitive framework for photonic devices simulation using MATLAB.

> **Note:** The toolbox is currently in its early development stage. New features for high-dimensional 
simulation, advanced analysis, and optimization will be coming in next release!

## Key Features
- **Customizable Geometry**: Simple geometry and mesh creation.
- **Object-Oriented Implementation**: Leverage modular MATLAB Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) capability
for expandability and scalability.

## Prerequires
- **MATLAB**: Version R2014b or later

## Toolbox Installation
1. Clone/download this repository.
2. Start MATLAB.
3. Install the Toolbox by double-clicking on the `FDFDPhotonicToolbox.mltbx` in MATLAB.

## Examples 
Under the `examples/` directory, live scripts demonstrate the working flow of the Toolbox:

| Structure | FDFD Solver | File Name | 
|---|---|---|
| Directional coupler | `Scattering2D` | `directional_coupler.mlx` |
| Grating coupler | `Scattering2D` | `grating_coupler.mlx` |
| Metallic transmission line | `EigenMode2D` | `transmission_line.mlx` |
